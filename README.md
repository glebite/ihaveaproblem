# ihaveaproblem
A strange little project that I run to keep tabs on the world.  

## TODO:  

- convert TODO into issues ;)  
- improve threading  
- move logging into separate config file  
- allow for not only country but city and places and new cameras  
- change out sys.arg to params  
- better logging  
- variable placement of the images and .html file  
- URL tracking database (for some reasons)  
- multicam retrieval for cameras with chn= or channel= fields  
- streaming formats into capture image (possibly opencv?)
